What is a website, and how is it different from a web application? 
A website is used to provide information to its users. Its function is for reading only, unlike web applications, where users can perform tasks like filling out forms or requesting data.

Why do you think organizations ( like offices or schools) need websites?
Offices and schools need a website where they can post information such as policies and schedules that can be accessed 24/7. In this way, people from that organization or group can have reliable sources and can easily access information.

What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?
I had trouble finding and editing a README, so I attempted to create it several times until I realized I hadn't clicked a certain button.

How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects? 
In future projects, a README can provide clear and simple guide that helps to maintain project organization.
